# Virtual-Octagon
A virtual environment for the Duan Octagon behavioural assay. Agent is using visual observations as sensors as well as geospatial knowledge of ports, egocentric positioning and speed.

Remaining items to do:
- Add second agent
- Add horiztonal rotation to allow agent to have 360 degree view
- Duplicate arena to enhance training times
- Agree on design choices to make environment match reality as much as possible
